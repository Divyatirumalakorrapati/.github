        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Ensure all history is fetched to avoid any shallow cloning issues

      - name: Set up C++ toolchain
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake clang

      # Step 3: Check if the repository was checked out correctly
      - name: Verify repository contents
        run: |
          ls -alh
          git status

      # Step 4: Run your build steps (replace with your actual build commands)
      - name: Build the Project
        run: |
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
          make
          
      # Step 5: Add further steps such as fuzzing and symbolic execution once checkout and build are confirmed working.
